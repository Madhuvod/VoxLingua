  "text": " You shouldn't be embarrassed by your wealth. This contempt for money is just another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it. Uncle Michael, we love each other very much. And we want to be married. I came to ask for your blessing. Francesca is my oldest brother's daughter. My brother suddenly died many years ago. And I guess I've been sort of a father to her. I've been a uncle. I love her very much. That's so lying. Well, I appreciate you coming here before you. When I head with your plans, shows you're a considered man. You go to college? Yes, sir. I do. What are you studying? Fine arts. How do you plan to support your new wife on Fine Arts? Sorry, I just get embarrassed to say it, sir, but... I'm a major stockholder in the family corporation. Well, what can I say after that? Of course you have my blessing. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. You know you might consider taking a course in business administration just to be on the safe side.",
