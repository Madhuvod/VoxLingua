  "text": " A lot of people said Asian, LOL, I thought you were Asian. I don't know if it's because I have a lot of Asian friends. Or if it's like my winged eyeliner, which like everybody kind of wears. But people have been assuming that I'm Asian for years. So much so that people in offline TV, they call me an honorary Asian. But in reality, I am proudly Moroccan. I low-key feel like you could beat someone's ass if necessary. And yeah, I mean, can't anybody? I thought that was normal. Like, if I needed to for self-defense, I'm going all out for me being like survival the fittest. I'm doing whatever I need to do. Also, if you're picking on one of my friends, it's over.",
