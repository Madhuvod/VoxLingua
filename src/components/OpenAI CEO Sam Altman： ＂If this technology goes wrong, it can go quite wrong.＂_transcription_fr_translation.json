  "original_text": " I alluded in my opening remarks to the jobs issue, the economic effects on employment. I think you have said, in fact, and I'm going to quote, development of superhuman machine intelligence is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity. End quote, you may have had in mind the effect on jobs, which is really my biggest nightmare in the long term. Let me ask you what your biggest nightmare is and whether you share that concern. Like with all technological revolutions, I expect there to be significant impact on jobs, but exactly what that impact looks like is very difficult to predict. If we went back to the other side of a previous technological revolution, we're talking about the jobs that exist on the other side. You can go back and read books of this. It's what people said at the time. It's difficult. I believe that there will be far greater jobs on the other side of this. And the jobs of today will get better. I think it's important. First of all, I think it's important to understand and think about GPD4 as a tool, not a creature, which is easy to get confused. And it's a tool that people have a great deal of control over and how they use it. And second, GPD4 and things, other systems like it, are good at doing tasks, not jobs. And so you see already people that are using GPD4 to do their job much more efficiently by helping them with tasks. Now, GPD4 will, I think, entirely automate away some jobs. And it will create new ones that we believe will be much better. This happens, again, my understanding of the history of technology is one long technological revolution, not a bunch of different ones put together. But this has been continually happening. We, as our quality of life, races and as machines and tools that we create can help us live better lives, the bar races for what we do and our human ability, and what we spend our time going after, goes after more ambitious, more satisfying projects. So there will be an impact on jobs. We try to be very clear about that. And I think it will require partnership between the industry and government, but mostly action by government to figure out how we want to mitigate that. But I'm very optimistic about how great the jobs of the future will be. Thank you. Let me ask Ms. Mike Gummary and Professor Marcus for your reactions to those questions as well. Ms. Mike Gummary? On the jobs point. Yeah, I mean, well, it's a hugely important question. And it's one that we've been talking about for a really long time at IBM. We do believe that AI, and we've said it for a long time, is going to change every job. New jobs will be created. Many more jobs will be transformed, and some jobs will transition away. I'm a personal example of a job that didn't exist when I joined IBM. And I have a team of AI governance professionals who are in new roles that we created as early as three years ago. I mean, they're new and they're growing. So I think the most important thing that we could be doing, and Ken and should be doing now, is to prepare the workforce of today and the workforce of tomorrow for partnering with AI technologies and using them. And we've been very involved for years now in doing that, in focusing on skills-based hiring, in educating for the skills of the future. Our skills-build platform has seven million learners in over 1,000 courses worldwide focused on skills. And we've pledged to train 30 million individuals by 2030 in the skills that are needed for society today. Thank you, Professor Marcus. May I go back to the first question as well? Absolutely. On the subject of nutrition labels, I think we absolutely need to do that. I think that there are some technical challenges in that building proper nutrition labels goes hand in hand with transparency. The biggest scientific challenge in understanding these models is how they generalize. What do they memorize and what new things do they do? The more that there's in the data set, for example, the thing that you want to test accuracy on, the less you can get a proper read on that. So it's important, first of all, that scientists be part of that process. And second, that we have much greater transparency about what actually goes into these systems. If we don't know what's in them, then we don't know exactly how well they're doing when they give something new. And we don't know how good a benchmark that will be for something that's entirely novel. So I could go into that more, but I want to flag that. Second is on jobs, past performance history is not a guarantee of the future. It has always been the case in the past that we have had more jobs that new jobs, new professions, come in as new technologies come in. I think this one's going to be different. And the real question is over what time scale? Is it going to be 10 years? Is it going to be 100 years? And I don't think anybody knows the answer to that question. I think in the long run, so-called artificial general intelligence really will replace a large fraction of human jobs. We're not that close to artificial general intelligence. Despite all of the media hype and so forth, I would say that what we have right now is just a small sampling of the AI that we will build. 20 years people will laugh at this. As I think it was Senator Hawley made the, but maybe Senator Durbin made the example about this, it was Senator Durbin made the example about cell phones. When we look back at the AI of today, 20 years ago, we'll be like, wow, that stuff was really unreliable. It couldn't really do planning, which is an important technical aspect. It's reasoning was ability. In reasoning abilities, we're limited. But when we get to AGI artificial general intelligence, maybe let's say it's 50 years, that really is going to have, I think, profound effects on labor. And there's just no way around that. And last, I don't know if I'm allowed to do this, but I will note that Sam's worst fear, I do not think, is employment. And he never told us what his worst fear actually is. And I think it's germane to find out. Thank you. I'm going to ask Mr. Altman if he cares to respond. Yeah. Look, we have tried to be very clear about the magnitude of the risks here. I think jobs and employment and what we're all going to do with our time really matters. I agree that when we get to very powerful systems, the landscape will change. I think I'm just more optimistic that we are incredibly creative and we find new things to do with better tools and that will keep happening. My worst fears are that we cause significant. We, the field, the technology, the industry cause significant harm to the world. I think that could happen in a lot of different ways. It's why we started the company. It's a big part of why I'm here today and why we've been here in the past and been able to spend some time with you. I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong. And we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening. But we try to be very clearied about what the downside case is and the work that we have to do to mitigate that. Thank you. And Anne.",

Laissez-moi vous demander quel est votre plus grand cauchemar et si vous partagez cette préoccupation. Comme avec toutes les révolutions technologiques, je m'attends à ce qu'il y ait un impact significatif sur les emplois, mais exactement ce que cette technologie semble être très difficile à prévoir. Si nous sommes retournés à l'autre côté d'une révolution technologique précédente, nous parlons des emplois qui existent de l'autre côté."
