 Evening everyone, it's a pleasure to have you here tonight to honor my dad's life and work. So, the way I was planning this, she asked me to help out with a little tribute to the certain flavor. And after a lot of convincing, well, here we are. Is he about to strip? I just remember. He's going to master being on stage to a photo of dad. My boy Squiggle cooked up this beat for me. Check it, born on the north back, king of the east side. 50 years strong, now he's rolling in a sick, right hand made suits. Raking in loops, five star general, your best salute. Yo, bitches be sad, but the king is not. No. K-W-A. I really, it is burning my eye, but I cannot look away. Out to the OG, do be the OG, A and he playin'. Playing like a pro, C, out to the OG, do be the OG, A and he playin'. Playing like a pro, make some noise, A1 ratings, A-E-K-1. Never gonna stop, baby, fuck, for the time, bro. Don't get it twisted, I've been through hell, but since I stand dead, I'm alive and well. Chaper of views, creator of news, father of many paid all his dues. So don't try to run, your mouth at the king, just pucker up, bitch and go kiss the ring. Out to the OG, do be the OG, A and he playin'. Make some noise, when I say, L, you say OG, out to the OG, L to the OG, L to the OG, L to the OG, L to the OG, I think this might be the end of the company, because you make it something to black hole embarrassment that we never get out of. Dundee at the motherfucking house.
