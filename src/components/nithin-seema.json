  "text": "Hi, I'm Sima, I'm from Belga. For the last couple of years, I was working in Singapore, and the reason I came back to India was because of the coronavirus. I love swimming, I love running. So, I'm Nathan, and I met Austin in Singapore. I met Austin to pitch for Zeroda. Zeroda is a stock-breaking firm. It's one of the fastest growing stock-breaking firms in the country. Me and Austin partnered for Zeroda, and that's when Austin also came up with a brilliant idea of FFC. Probably the first fitness fight club in the country. So, yeah, so we both are pretty active. We run, we cycle, we happily basketball. But at the end of the day, we try to make some time to come to the gym and fight to stay fit. I'm sounding like I'm selling, but you have to come and check it out yourself. Yeah, so you could take it as a guarantee from my side that you're going to love what you're going to do here.",
